## How to make your kyberia run.

1.  Install: apache2 (+php&mysql support ), mysql
2.  Create mysql account ( create user kyberia identified by "pass")
3.  Create database kyberia2 (as user kyberia)
4.  Import data (mysql -u kyberia -p kyberia2 < kyberia_2.3_...sql )
5.  Copy http dir from repository into your www-root ( XXX)
6.  Copy kyberia-data dir into same directory.
7.  Include kyberia.conf into your apache conf.
    (dir /etc/apache2/sites-enabled in debian). Edit if needed.
8.  Maybe you will need some apache configuration tweaks (like a2enmod rewrite).
9.  Start apache and mysql (something like /etc/init.d/apache2 start, ...)
10. Set DB login data in inc/db.inc
11. Depends on your DNS, maybe add alias www.localhost to /etc/hosts file.
12. Try it (open browser and go to your system_url address. "localhost" by default.)
13. Find out why it is still not working. (check permisions, symlinks, directory names...)
14. If you want full functionality, add following lines to your www users crontab

   XXX
   */2 * * * * /path-to-kyberia-wwwroot/cron/logoutidle.php
   0 0 * * * /path-to-kyberia-wwwroot/cron/k.php
   */3 * * * * /path-to-kyberia-wwwroot/cron/process-img.sh

   Warning, this effectively bypass www chroot.
15. Enjoy;)
