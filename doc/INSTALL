## How to make your kyberia run.

1.  Install webserver. For example apache2 or lighthttpd (+php&mysql support)
2.  Instal db backend. mysql is supported so far.
2.  Create mysql account ( create user kyberia identified by "pass")
3.  Create database kyberia2 (as user kyberia)
4.  Download sql data from http://dev.kyberia.cz/-sql/
4.  Import data (mysql -u kyberia -p kyberia2 < kyberia_...sql )
5.  Clone code from git repository into your www-root ( XXX)
7.  Include kyberia.conf into your (apache?) conf.
    (dir /etc/apache2/sites-enabled in debian). Edit if needed.
8.  Maybe you will need some apache configuration tweaks (like a2enmod rewrite).
9.  Start webserver and backend (something like /etc/init.d/apache2 start, ...)
10. Set DB login data in wwwroot/conf/config.inc
11. Depends on your DNS, maybe add alias www.localhost to /etc/hosts file.
12. Try it (open browser and go to your system_url address. "localhost" by default.)
13. Find out why it is still not working. (check permisions, symlinks, directory names...)
14. If you want full functionality, add scripts from cron directory to your www users crontab

    Warning, this effectively bypass www chroot.
15. Enjoy;)
