## How to make your kyberia run.

1.  Install: apache2 (+php support), mysql
2.  Create mysql account ( create user kyberia identified by "pass")
3.  Create database kyberia2 (as user kyberia)
4.  Import data (mysql -u kyberia -p kyberia2 < kyberia_2.3_...sql )
5.  Copy http dir from svn into your www-root (for example cp kyberia/trunk /var/www/ )
6.  Copy kyberia-data dir into same directory.
7.  Copy 003-kyberia.conf (apache2 conf. file) into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled. Edit if needed.
8.  Maybe you will need something apache configuration tweaks (like a2enmod rewrite).
9.  Start apache and mysql (something like /etc/init.d/apache2 start, ...)
10. Set DB login data in inc/db.inc
11. Depends on your DNS, maybe add alias www.localhost to /etc/hosts file.
12. Try it (open browser and go to your system_url address. "localhost" by default.)
13. Find out why it is still not working. (check permisions, symlinks, directory names...)
14. If you want full functionality, add following lines to your www users crontab

   */2 * * * * /path-to-kyberia-wwwroot/cron/logoutidle.php
   0 0 * * * /path-to-kyberia-wwwroot/cron/k.php
   */3 * * * * /path-to-kyberia-wwwroot/cron/process-img.sh

   Warning, this effectively bypass www chroot.
15. Enjoy;)
